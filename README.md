This is a simple and powerful CLI tool written in python which can automate student information extraction from AU , and
eventually makes our lives better.
This script simply uses **selenium to enter form feilds** , the interesting part is that this scrip **automatically solves the
captcha generated by COE AU Website.**
Thus saves a lot of time , This can also help you if you want to check marks in **bulk** , Just execute this script , drink
your coffee and wait for the script to show your requested information.

**IMPORTANT**: Currently the script is partially tested ,(i.e cracking captcha seems work good and enters data in the login form) but I did not scrape any information , The full login process was not tested because the COE AU Website is not responding , Thus
when it comes alive and stable I will test everything.

**NOTE**: Only tested on linux , may or may not work in other platforms.
